If so, you will need an Term Operating loan.\n\nDo you need to purchase real estate, make capital improvements to the farm, or new construction projects? You will need a Farm Ownership loan.\n\nHave you suffered a loss to your farming operation due to a natural disaster? If so, you will need an Emergency loan.\n\nEmergency loan programs are triggered by a natural disaster as designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. These loans help producers who suffered qualifying farm related losses directly caused by the disaster and a county declared or designated as a disaster or quarantined area.\n\nPlease note that more than one loan or any combination of two loans may be requested.

If so, you will need an Term Operating loan.\n\nDo you need to purchase real estate, make capital improvements to the farm, or new construction projects? You will need a Farm Ownership loan.\n\nHave you suffered a loss to your farming operation due to a natural disaster? If so, you will need an Emergency loan.\n\nEmergency loan programs are triggered by a natural disaster as designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. These loans help producers who suffered qualifying farm related losses directly caused by the disaster and a county declared or designated as a disaster or quarantined area.\n\nPlease note that more than one loan or any combination of two loans may be requested.
